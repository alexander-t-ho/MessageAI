# 🔍 **TEST WITH DEBUG OUTPUT - Find the Problem!**

## 🎯 **What We're Doing:**

I've added LOUD debug output to show exactly what's being sent. This will help us find why Test User 2 isn't receiving messages!

3. **IMMEDIATELY look at the Xcode console**

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL: What to Look For in Console**

### **On iPhone 17 Console, you SHOULD see:**

```
🚀🚀🚀 SENDING MESSAGE VIA WEBSOCKET:
   Sender ID: d4082418-f021-70d5-9d09-816dc3e72d20
   Sender Name: Test User
   Recipient ID: b4c85408-00c1-70fb-0759-2cc64ee2e15c
   Conversation ID: [some-uuid]
   Participant IDs: ["d4082418-f021-70d5-9d09-816dc3e72d20", "b4c85408-00c1-70fb-0759-2cc64ee2e15c"]
🚀🚀🚀
✅ Message sent via WebSocket: [message-id]
```

### **On iPhone 16e Console, you SHOULD see:**

```
📥 Handling received WebSocket message: [message-id]
✅ Message added to conversation
```

---

## 📋 **Copy This Information:**

After you send the message, copy and paste **ALL** of these from the console:

### **From iPhone 17 Console:**
1. The entire "🚀🚀🚀 SENDING MESSAGE VIA WEBSOCKET" block
2. Any lines that say "✅ Message sent via WebSocket"
3. Any ERROR lines (if any)

### **From iPhone 16e Console:**
1. The login success line (shows the user ID)
2. Any lines about WebSocket connection
3. Any lines about receiving messages
4. Any ERROR lines (if any)

---

## 🎯 **What I Need to See:**

Please paste:

**1. iPhone 17 Console Output:**
```
[Paste here - starting from the 🚀🚀🚀 block]
```

**2. iPhone 16e Console Output:**
```
[Paste here - the full console from after login]
```

**3. Did the message appear on iPhone 16e?** (Yes/No)

---

## 🔍 **What We're Checking:**

### **✅ Good Signs:**
- Recipient ID matches Test User 2's login ID
- Participant IDs contains both user IDs
- "Message sent via WebSocket" appears
- No errors in console

### **❌ Bad Signs:**
- Recipient ID is "unknown-recipient"
- Participant IDs has wrong values
- WebSocket errors
- "Failed to send" messages

---

## 💡 **Common Issues We Might Find:**

### **Issue #1: Wrong Recipient ID**
```
Recipient ID: unknown-recipient
```
**Meaning:** The conversation wasn't created with the right user IDs

### **Issue #2: Not Finding User in Search**
```
Participant IDs: ["d4082418-...", "test-user-id"]
```
**Meaning:** You tapped "Create" without selecting a search result

### **Issue #3: WebSocket Not Connected**
```
❌ Cannot send message - not connected
```
**Meaning:** WebSocket disconnected, need to reconnect

---

## 🚀 **DO THIS NOW:**

1. **Delete app** from BOTH simulators
2. **Rebuild** on BOTH devices (Cmd+R)
3. **Login** on both
4. **Create conversation** on iPhone 17 (search "Test User 2", tap result)
5. **Send message** on iPhone 17
6. **Copy console output** from BOTH devices
7. **Paste it here** and tell me if the message appeared on iPhone 16e!

**The debug output will tell us EXACTLY what's going wrong!** 🔍📱
