# Edit Message Sync Issue - Diagnosis & Fix

## 🔍 Issue Found
The edit messages are **NOT reaching the API Gateway/Lambda** at all. The edit happens locally but isn't being sent through WebSocket.

## 📊 Evidence
1. **Lambda Logs**: The editMessage Lambda hasn't been invoked (except our test)
2. **API Gateway**: No "editMessage" actions in access logs
3. **Client Side**: Edit is applied locally but `sendEditMessage` may not be executing

## 🐛 Possible Causes
1. **WebSocket Not Connected**: The WebSocket might be disconnected when editing
2. **recipientIds Issue**: The recipient IDs might be empty or incorrect
3. **Silent Failure**: The function might be failing without proper error reporting

## ✅ Fix Applied
Added comprehensive debug logging to `WebSocketService.sendEditMessage()`:
```swift
print("🔵 sendEditMessage called")
print("   Connection state: \(connectionState)")
print("   WebSocket task: \(webSocketTask != nil ? "exists" : "nil")")
print("   Recipients: \(recipientIds)")
print("   Payload: \(payload)")
print("   JSON: \(json)")
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Rebuild Both Apps
1. Clean Build Folder (⌘⇧K) 
2. Build & Run (⌘R) on both simulators

### Step 2: Test Edit with Console Open
1. **Open Console on iPhone 17** (sender)
2. Send a message to iPhone 16e
3. Long press YOUR message → Edit
4. Change the text
5. Tap checkmark

### Step 3: Check Console Output
Look for these logs:
- `🔵 sendEditMessage called` - Function was triggered
- `Connection state:` - Should show "connected"
- `Recipients:` - Should show the recipient's user ID
- `✅ Edit sent via WebSocket` - Successfully sent
- `❌ Cannot send edit` - Failed to send (with reason)

## 🚨 Important Observations

From your screenshot, I noticed:
- **iPhone 16e shows "No Conversations Yet"** - This suggests a bigger sync issue
- Messages might not be syncing properly between devices

## 📋 Next Steps Based on Console Output

### If you see "❌ Cannot send edit - not connected":
→ WebSocket connection is broken. Check network/reconnect.

### If you see "❌ Cannot send edit - webSocketTask is nil":
→ WebSocket task wasn't created properly. Restart app.

### If you see "Recipients: []" (empty array):
→ Issue with conversation participant IDs.

### If you see "✅ Edit sent" but no sync:
→ Backend issue. We'll need to check Lambda permissions.

### If you don't see any logs:
→ The edit function isn't being called at all.

## 🔧 Quick Fix Attempts

1. **Force Reconnect**: 
   - Toggle airplane mode ON then OFF
   - This forces WebSocket reconnection

2. **Clear & Restart**:
   - Delete apps from both simulators
   - Clean build & reinstall

3. **Check Basic Messaging**:
   - Verify regular messages work first
   - If not, fix messaging before edits

## 📝 Report Back
Please run the test and share:
1. The console output from the edit attempt
2. Whether regular messages are syncing
3. Any error messages you see

This will tell us exactly where the edit message is failing!
