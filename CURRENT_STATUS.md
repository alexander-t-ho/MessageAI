## 🎯 Phase 0 Complete When...

You can tell me:
- ✅ "I can see Hello, World! in the iOS Simulator"
- ✅ "Xcode is working"
- ✅ "AWS is configured" (or "I'll do AWS later")

Then we proceed to **Phase 1: User Authentication**!

## 📖 Helpful Commands

```bash
# Go to project directory:
cd /Users/alexho/MessageAI

open AWS_SETUP.md

# Check what files you have:
ls -la

# Check Xcode (after installation):
xcodebuild -version

# Check AWS (after configuration):

## 📱 What the Simulator Should Look Like

When Phase 0 is complete, you'll see:
- A window that looks like an iPhone
- White background
- Text saying "Hello, World!" in the center
- This confirms your development environment is ready!

2. Read `QUICK_START.md` while it downloads
3. Create the project when Xcode is ready
