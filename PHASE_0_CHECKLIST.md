## Part 2: AWS CLI Configuration ‚è≥

### Tasks:
- [ ] **Verify AWS CLI is installed** ‚úÖ (Already done - v2.4.13)

- [ ] **Configure AWS Credentials**
  - Run: `aws configure`
  - Enter Access Key ID
  - Enter Secret Access Key
  - Default region: `us-east-1`
  - Default output format: `json`

- No "Unable to locate credentials" error

### üìù Note:
If you don't have AWS credentials yet, see `AWS_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.

---

## Part 3: Project Structure ‚úÖ (Complete)

Created:
- ‚úÖ `/Users/alexho/MessageAI/` directory
- ‚úÖ `README.md` with project overview
- ‚úÖ `SETUP_GUIDE.md` with step-by-step instructions
- ‚úÖ `AWS_SETUP.md` with AWS configuration help
- ‚úÖ `.gitignore` for Xcode and Node.js
- ‚úÖ `backend/` directory structure for Lambda functions

---

## How to Verify Phase 0 is Complete

### Test 1: Xcode & Simulator
```bash
# From Terminal, check Xcode is properly installed:
xcodebuild -version
```
**Expected**: Should show Xcode version (e.g., "Xcode 15.0")

### Test 2: Run Your App
1. Open Xcode
2. Open MessageAI.xcodeproj
3. Select iPhone 15 Pro simulator
4. Press Cmd+R
5. Wait for simulator to launch
6. See "Hello, World!"

### Test 3: AWS Configuration
```bash
# From Terminal:
cd /Users/alexho/MessageAI
aws sts get-caller-identity
```
**Expected**: JSON output with UserId, Account, and Arn

---

## Phase 0 Complete When:

‚úÖ **All of these are true:**
1. Xcode is installed and launches
2. MessageAI project created in `/Users/alexho/MessageAI/`
3. iOS Simulator shows "Hello, World!" when you run the app
4. AWS CLI is configured (credentials work)
5. No errors in Xcode when building
6. You understand how to:
   - Run the app (Cmd+R)
   - Select different simulators
   - See the code editor and device preview

---

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

### Xcode Issues:
- **"xcode-select: error"**: Run `sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer`
- **Simulator won't launch**: Run `xcrun simctl erase all` in Terminal
- **Build fails**: Product ‚Üí Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K), then build again

### AWS Issues:
- **No credentials**: Run `aws configure` and enter your keys
- **Access denied**: Check IAM user has sufficient permissions
- **Wrong region**: Rerun `aws configure` and set to `us-east-1`

---

## Next Phase Preview

**Phase 1: User Authentication** will involve:
- Creating AWS Cognito User Pool (web console)
- Setting up API Gateway
- Creating Lambda functions for signup/login
- Building Swift authentication views
- Testing login/signup flow

## üõë STOP HERE üõë

**Please complete the checklist above and let me know when:**
1. You can see "Hello, World!" in the iOS Simulator
2. AWS CLI is configured (or if you need help with this)

**Share with me:**
- ‚úÖ "Xcode is working, I see Hello World"
- ‚úÖ "AWS is configured" or "I need help with AWS"
- Any errors or issues you encountered

Once you confirm Phase 0 is complete, we'll move to **Phase 1: User Authentication**! üöÄ
