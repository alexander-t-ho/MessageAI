## 📊 Time Breakdown

**Total Time**: ~2 hours (with troubleshooting)
- Xcode installation: 20 minutes
- Project creation: 5 minutes
- Troubleshooting simulator: 90 minutes
  - Black screen issues
  - Simulator performance
  - Cache clearing
  - Simulator selection
- Documentation: 10 minutes

## 🎓 What You Learned

1. **How to create an iOS project in Xcode**
2. **How to run apps in the iOS Simulator**
3. **How to use Cmd+R to build and run**
4. **How to select different simulators**
5. **How to troubleshoot simulator issues**
6. **Basic project structure understanding**

## ⏭️ Next Steps: Phase 1 - User Authentication

### What We'll Build Next:

1. **AWS Cognito User Pool** (backend authentication)
2. **Lambda Functions** for signup/login/token refresh
3. **API Gateway** REST endpoints
4. **Swift Authentication Views:**
   - Login screen
   - Signup screen
   - Password validation
5. **Network Service** to connect iOS app to AWS

### Prerequisites for Phase 1:

**Required:**
- ✅ Xcode working (DONE!)
- ⏳ AWS credentials configured

**Optional (can do during Phase 1):**
- AWS account created
- Basic AWS Console familiarity

### Estimated Time for Phase 1:
**2-3 hours** (including AWS setup if needed)

---

## 🚀 Ready to Continue?

You have two options:

### Option A: Configure AWS Now
If you have AWS credentials ready:
```bash
aws configure
```
Enter your credentials, then we start Phase 1 immediately.

### Option B: Start Phase 1 Setup
We can start setting up the backend while you work on AWS credentials in parallel.

**Let me know when you're ready to proceed to Phase 1!**
