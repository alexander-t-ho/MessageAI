## 📋 **REMAINING FEATURES (For Next Session)**

Based on your feedback, here's what still needs implementation:

### 1. **App Icon on Home Screen** 📱
**Issue**: Still shows "MessageAI" on home screen

**Fix**: Update in Xcode project settings (not code)
```
1. Open Xcode
2. Click project navigator (blue icon at top)
3. Select "MessageAI" target
4. General tab → Display Name → Change to "Cloudy"
5. Build and run
```

**Or**: Edit `Info.plist`:
```xml
<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
<string>Cloudy</string>
```

### 2. **Enhanced User Profile from Context Menu** 🔍
**What**: Long press user name in conversation → Show detailed profile

**Shows**:
- Username (e.g., @test_user_2) - cannot be changed
- Online status (🟢 Online or ⚫ Offline + last seen time)
- Current nickname (editable)
- Upload custom photo for this user
- All persists after logout

**Implementation**: 
- Update ChatHeaderView to show UserProfileView instead of EditNicknameView
- Add username field to UserProfileView
- Add last seen time tracking

**Time**: ~20 minutes

### 3. **Read Receipt Details in Group Chat** 📊
**What**: Long press sender's message in group chat → Show who read it

**Design**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│  Translate & Explain        │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  📖 Read By (2/3 members)   │
│  ✓ John Doe      2:45 PM    │
│  ✓ Jane Smith    2:46 PM    │
│  • Mike Johnson  (not read) │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│  Forward                    │
│  Delete                     │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

**Features**:
- Scrollable list if many members
- Shows who read with timestamp
- Shows who hasn't read (greyed out)
- Above "Delete" option in context menu

**Implementation**:
- Create ReadReceiptDetailsView component
- Add to message context menu (only for sender's messages in groups)
- Parse readByUserNames and readTimestamps from message

**Time**: ~30 minutes

### 4. **Last Seen Time Tracking** ⏰
**What**: Show when user was last online

**Examples**:
- "Online" (if currently online)
- "Last online a few seconds ago" (< 1 min)
- "Last online 5m ago" (< 1 hour)
- "Last online 2h ago" (< 24 hours)
- "Last online yesterday at 3:45 PM" (> 24 hours)

**Implementation**:
- Backend already tracks in presence updates
- Add lastSeenTimes to WebSocketService
- Display in UserProfileView and ChatHeaderView

**Time**: ~20 minutes
