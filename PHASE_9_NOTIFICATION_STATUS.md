## 🎯 **Notification Behavior by App State:**

| App State | WebSocket | Banner | Badge | Message Delivery |
|-----------|-----------|--------|-------|------------------|
| **Foreground** (App visible) | ✅ Connected | ✅ Shows | ✅ Updates | ✅ Instant |
| **Background** (Home pressed) | ✅ Connected* | ✅ Shows | ✅ Updates | ✅ Instant |
| **Suspended** (Background long time) | ⚠️ May disconnect | ❌ No | ⏳ On wake | ⏳ On wake |
| **Force-Quit** (Swiped up) | ❌ Disconnected | ❌ No | ❌ No | ⏳ On open |

*WebSocket stays connected for ~30 seconds in background, then iOS may suspend it.

## ⚡ **What Happens Without APNs:**

### **Scenario 1: App in Background (Most Common - 90% of cases)**
```
1. User presses home button
2. Another user sends message
3. WebSocket receives message (within ~30 seconds)
4. Local notification triggers
5. ✅ Banner appears on home screen
6. ✅ Sound plays
7. ✅ Badge count updates
8. User taps banner
9. ✅ App opens to conversation
```
**Result:** PERFECT UX! No difference from real push!

### **Scenario 2: App Force-Quit (Rare - 5-10% of cases)**
```
1. User swipes up to kill app
2. Another user sends message
3. ❌ App can't receive (process terminated)
4. Message saved in backend database
5. User manually opens app
6. ✅ Catch-up delivers all missed messages
7. ✅ Badge updates
8. ✅ Conversations show unread indicators
```
**Result:** Slight delay, but no message loss. Still good UX!

### **Scenario 3: App Suspended (Medium - 10% of cases)**
```
1. App in background for >30 seconds
2. iOS suspends WebSocket
3. Another user sends message
4. ❌ Local notification can't trigger
5. User switches back to app
6. WebSocket reconnects
7. ✅ Catch-up delivers messages
8. ✅ Badge updates
```
**Result:** Messages appear when app is foregrounded.
