# 🔍 **DEBUG: Why Messages Aren't Being Received**

## ❓ **What We Know:**

From your screenshot:
- ✅ iPhone 17 (Test User): Message appears on RIGHT (blue) - saved locally
- ❌ iPhone 16e (Test User 2): No conversation appears - message NOT received
- ✅ WebSocket connected on both devices
- ❌ Message not delivered via WebSocket

---

## 🕵️ **Let's Debug Step-by-Step:**

### **Step 1: Check iPhone 17 Console Output**

**On iPhone 17 (the one that sent "Hello from Test User!"):**

Look in the console for these lines:

**What you SHOULD see:**
```
✅ Message saved locally: [message-id]
✅ Message added to UI - now showing 1 messages
✅ Message sent via WebSocket: [message-id]
```

**What might indicate a problem:**
```
❌ Error sending message: ...
❌ WebSocket receive error: ...
```

### **Step 2: Check What Recipient ID Was Sent**

**We need to add debug logging to see what's being sent.**

Can you:
1. Click on the conversation on iPhone 17
2. Look in the console for any line that mentions "recipientId"
3. Copy and paste ALL console output from iPhone 17 after you sent the message

### **Step 3: Check Backend Logs**

Let me check if the backend received the message:

```bash
# Run this command to check Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/websocket-sendMessage_AlexHo --since 5m --follow
```

**What we're looking for:**
- Did the Lambda receive the message?
- What recipientId did it receive?
- Did it find Test User 2's connection?

## 🔧 **Most Likely Issues:**

### **Issue #1: Wrong Recipient ID**

The conversation might have been created with Test User 2's NAME instead of their USER ID.

**Check:** When you searched for "Test User 2", did you tap on the search result with the email "test2@example.com"?

### **Issue #2: Recipient Not Connected**

Test User 2's WebSocket might have connected, but the connection ID wasn't saved in the backend.

**Check:** Is the WebSocket showing "Connected" on iPhone 16e?

### **Issue #3: Backend Can't Find Recipient**

The backend Lambda might be looking for the wrong user ID in the connections table.

## 🚀 **Quick Fix: Add Debug Logging**

Let me add some loud debug output to see what's happening:
