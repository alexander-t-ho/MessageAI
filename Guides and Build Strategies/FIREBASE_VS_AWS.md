## 🔧 Implementation Comparison

### Authentication

**Firebase:**
```swift
// Simple email/password auth
try await Auth.auth().createUser(withEmail: email, password: password)
try await Auth.auth().signIn(withEmail: email, password: password)
```

**AWS:**
```swift
// Amplify Auth with Cognito
try await Amplify.Auth.signUp(username: email, password: password)
try await Amplify.Auth.signIn(username: email, password: password)
```

**Winner:** Tie (both are simple)

---

### Database Queries

**Firebase (Firestore):**
```swift
// Real-time listener
db.collection("messages")
  .whereField("chatId", isEqualTo: chatId)
  .order(by: "timestamp")
  .addSnapshotListener { snapshot, error in
    // Handle updates
  }
```

**AWS (AppSync + GraphQL):**
```swift
// Query with GraphQL
let query = """
query ListMessages($chatId: ID!) {
  listMessages(chatId: $chatId) {
    items {
      id
      text
      timestamp
    }
  }
}
"""

// Real-time subscription
subscription OnMessageReceived($chatId: ID!) {
  onMessageReceived(chatId: $chatId) {
    id
    text
    timestamp
  }
}
```

**Winner:** AWS (GraphQL is more powerful and typed)

---

### Image Upload

**Firebase:**
```swift
let storageRef = storage.reference().child("images/\(filename)")
_ = try await storageRef.putDataAsync(imageData)
let url = try await storageRef.downloadURL()
```

**AWS (S3):**
```swift
let uploadTask = Amplify.Storage.uploadData(
  key: "images/\(filename)",
  data: imageData
)
let result = try await uploadTask.value
let url = try await Amplify.Storage.getURL(key: result.key)
```

**Winner:** Tie (both are straightforward)

---

## 📈 Scalability Comparison

### Firebase Scaling
- ✅ Auto-scales (no config needed)
- ✅ Global CDN included
- ⚠️ Concurrent connection limits (1M connections/database)
- ⚠️ Write limits (10k/second per collection)
- ❌ Can't optimize costs easily

### AWS Scaling
- ✅ AppSync auto-scales (1M+ requests/sec)
- ✅ DynamoDB on-demand scaling
- ✅ S3 unlimited storage
- ✅ CloudFront for global delivery
- ✅ Fine-grained capacity control
- ✅ Cost optimization options (reserved capacity)

**Winner:** AWS (better for large scale)

---

## 🔐 Security Comparison

### Firebase Security Rules
```javascript
// Firestore Rules
match /chats/{chatId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth.uid in resource.data.participants;
}
```

### AWS IAM + AppSync Resolvers
```javascript
// AppSync Schema with Auth
type Chat @model @auth(rules: [
  { allow: owner, ownerField: "participants" }
]) {
  id: ID!
  participants: [ID!]!
}
```

**Winner:** Tie (both provide robust security)
