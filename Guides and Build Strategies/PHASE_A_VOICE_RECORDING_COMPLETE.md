2. If .granted → Start recording
3. If .denied → Request permission
4. If .undetermined → Request permission

Permission prompt:
"Cloudy would like to access your microphone to record voice messages"
```

### Recording Process:
```swift
1. Configure audio session
   - Category: .playAndRecord
   - Mode: .default
   - Options: .defaultToSpeaker

2. Create file URL
   - Path: Documents directory
   - Name: voice_{UUID}.m4a

3. Start AVAudioRecorder
   - Settings: AAC 64kbps mono
   - Metering enabled

4. Start timers
   - Duration timer: Updates every 0.1s
   - Level timer: Updates every 0.05s (for waveform)

5. On stop:
   - Check duration >= 1 second
   - Return file URL
   - Reset state
```

### File Storage:
```
Location: Documents directory
Format: voice_{uuid}.m4a
