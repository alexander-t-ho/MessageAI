## 🚀 Quick Deployment

### Run These Commands:

```bash
cd /Users/alexho/MessageAI/backend/voice

# 1. Create S3 bucket
bash setup-s3-bucket.sh

# 2. Deploy Lambda
bash deploy-voice-lambdas.sh

# 3. Copy the Lambda URL from output
# It will look like: https://abc123.lambda-url.us-east-1.on.aws/

# 4. Update S3VoiceStorage.swift line 22 with that URL

# 5. Build and test!
```

## 📱 How It Works

### User Experience:

**1. Record:**
```
Long press ↑
   ↓
▓▓▓░▓▓░░▓▓▓  Waveform
🔴 Recording... 0:15 ⏹️
```

**2. Preview:**
```
Tap ⏹️
   ↓
▓▓▓░▓▓░  Static waveform
▶️ 0:00 / 0:15  🗑️  ↑
```

**3. Send:**
```
Tap ↑
   ↓
Uploads to S3
   ↓
Sends via WebSocket
   ↓
Message appears!
```

## 🔧 Technical Flow

### Full Pipeline:
```
1. User long presses send
   ↓
2. Records audio (AVAudioRecorder)
   ↓
3. Saves to local file (voice_xxx.m4a)
   ↓
4. User taps send
   ↓
5. Calls Lambda to get upload URL
   ↓
6. Lambda generates pre-signed S3 URL
   ↓
7. iOS uploads file to S3
   ↓
8. Gets permanent S3 URL
   ↓
9. Creates MessageData with S3 URL
   ↓
10. Sends via WebSocket with URL
   ↓
11. Recipient receives message
   ↓
12. Downloads from S3 when played
   ↓
13. Caches locally for offline playback
```

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

### Test 1: Upload to S3
1. Long press send, record voice
2. Tap send
3. **Console should show:**
   ```
   ☁️ Starting S3 upload
   🔗 Got pre-signed URL
   ✅ Voice message uploaded to S3
   ```

### Test 2: Verify in S3
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://cloudy-voice-messages-alexho/ --recursive

# Should show:
# 2024-10-26 ... userId/messageId.m4a
```

### Test 3: End-to-End
1. Device A: Send voice message
2. **Check:** Uploads to S3
3. **Check:** Message sent via WebSocket
4. Device B: Receives message
5. Device B: Downloads from S3
6. Device B: Plays audio
