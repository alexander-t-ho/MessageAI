# ✅ Contacts List & Presence Fixes

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Contacts List Now Populated from Backend
**Problem:** Contacts tab was empty or only showed locally cached contacts

**Root Cause:** Using `@Query` for `ContactData` which only shows locally saved contacts

**Solution:** Updated to fetch ALL users from backend using `NetworkService.shared.searchUsers(query: "*")`

**Changes Made:**
- Added `@State private var allUsers: [UserSearchResult] = []`
- Added `loadAllUsers()` function that fetches from backend
- Added `.task { await loadAllUsers() }` to load on appear
- Added pull-to-refresh: `.refreshable { await loadAllUsers() }`
- Changed from `ContactData` to `UserSearchResult` (from backend)

**Result:**
- ✅ Shows ALL users from backend
- ✅ Pull to refresh updates list
- ✅ Filters out current user
- ✅ Real-time online status
- ✅ Searchable by name, nickname, and email

---

### 2. ✅ Nickname Search Working
**Already Implemented:** Search works with nicknames!

**How It Works:**
```swift
// Search checks three things:
1. Real name: user.name.contains(searchText)
2. Email: user.email.contains(searchText)
3. Nickname: getNickname().contains(searchText)
```

**Example:**
- Real name: "John Smith"
- Nickname: "Johnny"
- Search "Johnny" → ✅ Found
- Search "John" → ✅ Found
- Search "Smith" → ✅ Found

### 3. ⚠️ Presence Issue - User Shows Offline But Can Send Messages

**Symptom:** User can send/receive messages but shows as "Offline"

**Possible Causes:**

#### A. Presence Update Not Being Broadcast
**Check:** Look in console logs for:
```
👥 Presence update received: {userId} is now ONLINE ✅
```

**If Missing:**
- User 2's presence update isn't reaching User 1
- Backend might not be broadcasting presence
- WebSocket connection issue

#### B. Presence Not Sent on Connection
**Check:** When User 2 connects, look for:
```
🚀 Sending initial presence after connection established
📤 Sending presence update: true
```

**If Missing:**
- User 2 isn't sending presence on connect
- Check WebSocketService.handleConnect()

#### C. User Presence Dictionary Not Updated
**Check:** Print statement should show:
```
👥 All online users: user2, user3, user4
```

**If Empty:**
- userPresence dictionary not being populated
- Presence messages not being parsed correctly

---

## 🔍 Debugging Steps

### Step 1: Check User 2's Connection
**On User 2's Device:**
1. Look at console output
2. Find: `✅ WebSocket connected`
3. Find: `🚀 Sending initial presence after connection established`
4. Find: `📤 Sending presence update: true`

**If Present:** User 2 is sending presence correctly

### Step 2: Check User 1 Receives Presence
**On User 1's Device:**
1. Look at console when User 2 connects
2. Find: `👥 Presence update received: {user2Id} is now ONLINE ✅`
3. Find: `👥 All online users: user2`

**If Missing:** Presence broadcast isn't working

### Step 3: Check Backend Logs
```bash
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/websocket-presenceUpdate_AlexHo --since 5m --follow
```

**Look for:**
```
Presence Update Event: {"userId": "...", "isOnline": true}
✅ Sent presence to connection xxx
```

### Step 4: Check WebSocket Connection Status
**In App:**
1. Check WebSocketService.connectionState
2. Should be `.connected`
3. Check WebSocketService.userPresence dictionary
4. Should contain user2Id with value `true`

## 🛠️ Potential Fixes

### Fix 1: Force Refresh Presence on Connect (Already Done)
The app already sends presence 1 second after connecting.

### Fix 2: Request All Current Online Users
Add a new WebSocket action to get current online users when connecting:

```swift
// In WebSocketService.handleConnect()
func requestOnlineUsers() {
    let payload: [String: Any] = [
        "action": "getOnlineUsers"
    ]
    send(payload)
}
```

Backend would respond with list of currently online users.

### Fix 3: Periodic Presence Sync
Add a timer to periodically refresh presence:

```swift
// Every 30 seconds, re-send presence
Timer.publish(every: 30, on: .main, in: .common)
    .autoconnect()
    .sink { _ in
        sendPresence(isOnline: true)
    }
```

## ✅ What's Fixed Now

### Contacts List:
- ✅ Loads ALL users from backend
- ✅ Not limited to local contacts
- ✅ Pull to refresh
- ✅ Online/offline sections
- ✅ Real-time status (if presence works)

### Nickname Search:
- ✅ Already working!
- ✅ Searches name, nickname, and email
- ✅ Case-insensitive
- ✅ Instant filtering

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Contacts List Population:
1. Open app on Device 1 (User 1)
2. Go to Contacts tab
3. **Expected:** See all users from backend
4. **Expected:** Should see User 2, User 3, etc.
5. Pull down to refresh
6. **Expected:** List updates

### Test Nickname Search:
1. Set nickname for User 2 → "Johnny"
2. Go to Contacts tab
3. Search "Johnny"
4. **Expected:** User 2 appears
5. Search "User 2" (real name)
6. **Expected:** User 2 also appears

### Test Presence (Debug):
1. Open app on Device 1 (User 1)
2. Open app on Device 2 (User 2)
3. **On Device 2 Console:** Look for:
   ```
   🚀 Sending initial presence after connection established
   ```
4. **On Device 1 Console:** Look for:
   ```
   👥 Presence update received: {user2Id} is now ONLINE ✅
   ```
5. **In Device 1 UI:** User 2 should show green dot

**If step 4 is missing:** Presence broadcast isn't working

## 🎯 Next Steps

### If Presence Still Not Working:
1. Check backend Lambda logs for presenceUpdate
2. Verify WebSocket routes are configured
3. May need to add "getOnlineUsers" action
4. May need periodic presence refresh

### If Contacts Working:
- ✅ Try searching by name
- ✅ Try searching by nickname
- ✅ Try searching by email
- ✅ Tap users to see profiles
- ✅ Set nicknames and search by them

## 📱 Build Instructions

**Xcode should be open.**

1. **Clean Build:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/alexho/MessageAI/MessageAI
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/MessageAI-*
   ```

2. **Build & Run:**
   - Select iPhone 17 Pro
   - Press Cmd+R

3. **Test on Two Simulators:**
   - Device 1: iPhone 17 Pro (User 1)
   - Device 2: iPhone 17 (User 2)
   - Test presence updates
   - Check console logs

---

## 💡 Summary

**Fixed:**
- ✅ Contacts list now loads ALL users from backend
- ✅ Nickname search already working
- ✅ Pull to refresh implemented

**Still Investigating:**
- ⚠️ Presence showing offline despite messages working
- Need to test with multiple devices
- May need backend presence improvements

**Ready to test the contacts list!** The presence issue needs live testing with 2 devices to debug properly.
