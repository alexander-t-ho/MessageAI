# 🔧 Voice Message Playback Fixes Applied!

## ✅ **Issues Fixed:**

### 1. **WebSocket Voice Message Support** ✅
**Problem:** Voice messages were being sent as text placeholders instead of actual voice messages
**Fix:** Updated `WebSocketService.sendMessage()` to include voice message fields:
- `messageType: String?`
- `audioUrl: String?` 
- `audioDuration: Double?`
- `transcript: String?`
- `isTranscribing: Bool?`

### 2. **S3 Bucket Name Mismatch** ✅
**Problem:** S3VoiceStorage was using wrong bucket name
**Fix:** Updated bucket name from `"cloudy-voice-messages"` to `"cloudy-voice-messages-alexho"`

### 3. **Voice Message Payload** ✅
**Problem:** ChatView wasn't sending voice message data via WebSocket
**Fix:** Updated `sendVoiceMessageWithURL()` to pass voice message fields:
```swift
webSocketService.sendMessage(
    // ... existing parameters ...
    messageType: "voice",
    audioUrl: s3URL,
    audioDuration: duration
)
```

### 4. **Enhanced Error Logging** ✅
**Problem:** S3 upload errors weren't clearly visible
**Fix:** Added detailed error logging to see exactly what's failing

## 🎯 **What Should Work Now:**

### **Complete Voice Message Flow:**
1. **Record:** Long press send button → Record voice
2. **Upload:** Audio file uploads to S3 bucket
3. **Send:** WebSocket sends voice message with S3 URL
4. **Receive:** Other users get voice message bubbles
5. **Play:** Tap play → Downloads from S3 → Plays audio

### **Expected Behavior:**
- **Sending:** Voice messages should upload to S3 and send with `messageType: "voice"`
- **Receiving:** Other users should see voice message bubbles (not text)
- **Playback:** Tap play button should download from S3 and play audio

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

### **1. Build and Run:**
```bash
# Build in Xcode
# Check console for S3 upload logs
```

### **2. Test Voice Message:**
1. **Record:** Long press send button
2. **Send:** Voice message
3. **Check Console:** Look for:
   ```
   ☁️ Starting S3 upload for voice message
   📁 Audio data size: XXXX bytes
   🔑 S3 Key: userId/messageId.m4a
   🔗 Got pre-signed URL
   ✅ Voice message uploaded to S3
   🔗 S3 URL: https://cloudy-voice-messages-alexho.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/...
   ```

### **3. Test Reception:**
1. **Other User:** Should receive voice message bubble
2. **Play:** Tap play button
3. **Check Console:** Look for:
   ```
   📥 Downloading audio from S3: https://...
   🔊 Loaded audio: X.Xs
   ▶️ Playing audio
   ```

## 🔍 **Debug Information:**

### **If S3 Upload Fails:**
Check console for:
- `⚠️ S3 upload failed: [error details]`
- Lambda function URL accessibility
- Network connectivity

### **If Voice Messages Still Show as Text:**
Check console for:
- WebSocket message payload
- `messageType: "voice"` in sent messages
- Voice message fields in received messages

### **If Playback Doesn't Work:**
Check console for:
- S3 URL validity
- Download progress
- Audio player errors

## 🎉 **Expected Result:**

**Voice messages should now:**
- ✅ Upload to S3 successfully
- ✅ Send as voice messages (not text)
- ✅ Display as voice message bubbles
- ✅ Play audio from S3 when tapped

**Test and let me know what you see in the console!** 🚀🎙️

## 📱 **Next Steps:**

1. **Build and test** voice message recording
2. **Check console logs** for S3 upload success
3. **Test with another user** to verify reception
4. **Report any errors** you see in the console

**Voice message playback should now work end-to-end!** 🎊
