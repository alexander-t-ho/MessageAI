# 🗑️ **Soft Delete Feature - Test Guide**

## ✅ **What Changed**

### **Your Requirement:**
> "When I delete I still want it in stored message but I do not want either user to see it."

### **Implementation:**
- ✅ Deleted messages **stay in database** (for records/legal compliance)
- ✅ Hidden from **BOTH users** (sender and recipient)
- ✅ No "Message Deleted" placeholder shown
- ✅ Messages **completely disappear** from UI

---

## 🎯 **Delete Behavior**

### **1. Sending Messages** (status = "sending")
- **Action:** Deleted completely from database
- **Reason:** Not delivered yet, safe to remove
- **Result:** Message is gone from database

### **2. Sent/Delivered/Read Messages**
- **Action:** Soft delete (marked `isDeleted = true`)
- **Reason:** Keep for records, but hide from users
- **Result:** 
  - ✅ Stays in database
  - ❌ Hidden from UI (both users)
  - ✅ Can be retrieved if needed

---

## 🧪 **How to Test**

### **Step 1: Clean Build**

**In Xcode:**
1. Stop the app (⏹️)
2. **Product → Clean Build Folder** (Shift+Cmd+K)
3. **Build and Run** (Cmd+R)

---

### **Step 2: Open Console**

**IMPORTANT:** Open Xcode console to see logs!

1. Bottom panel in Xcode
2. Click **console icon** (speech bubble)
3. Or press **Shift+Cmd+C**

---

### **Step 3: Test Delete**

#### **A. Send and Delete a Message**

1. **Send a message:** "Test delete"
2. **Wait for checkmark** (message status = "sent")
3. **Long press** the message
4. **Tap "Delete"**

#### **B. Check UI**

**Expected:**
- ✅ Message **disappears completely**
- ❌ No "Message Deleted" placeholder
- ✅ Clean UI (like iMessage)

#### **C. Check Console**

**You should see:**
```
🗑️ Delete triggered for message: [message-id]
   Content: Test delete
   Status: sent
   Already deleted: false
   → Marking as deleted (soft delete - kept in database but hidden from UI)
   ✅ Message hidden from both users (still in database)
   ✅ isDeleted = true
```

---

### **Step 4: Verify Database (Optional)**

**To confirm message is still in database:**

1. Go back to **home screen**
2. Tap **"Profile"** tab (bottom right)
3. Scroll down to **"Test Database"** button
4. Tap **"Test Database"**
5. Look for **"All Messages"** section
6. You should see your deleted message with:
   - ✅ Content still there
   - ✅ `isDeleted: true`

**This proves:** Message is in database but hidden from chat UI!

## 🎨 **User Experience**

### **Before (Old Behavior):**
```
You:  Test message        10:48 AM ✓
You:  Message Deleted     10:49 AM
```
❌ Shows placeholder, takes up space, looks messy

### **After (New Behavior):**
```
You:  Test message        10:48 AM ✓
[Message is gone - clean UI]
```
✅ Clean, professional, like iMessage

---

## 🔍 **Edge Cases**

### **1. Deleting "Sending" Message**

**Test:**
1. Send a message (it shows "sending...")
2. Quickly long press and delete before it sends

**Expected:**
- Message deleted **completely** from database
- Console: "Deleting completely (sending status)"
- Not a soft delete (since it never sent)

### **2. Delete Replied Message**

**Test:**
1. Send message A: "Original"
2. Swipe right → Reply to it with message B: "Reply"
3. Delete message A (the original)

**Expected:**
- Message A disappears
- Message B still shows (but might show reply context as "[Deleted]" in future)

### **3. Delete Multiple Messages**

**Test:**
1. Send 5 messages
2. Delete messages 2, 3, and 4

**Expected:**
- Only messages 1 and 5 visible
- Clean UI with no gaps
- All 5 still in database (2, 3, 4 marked `isDeleted`)

---

## 🐛 **Troubleshooting**

### **Issue: Message Still Visible After Delete**

**Solutions:**
1. Did you rebuild? (Clean Build Folder)
2. Check console - is delete being called?
3. Close and reopen the conversation
4. Restart the app

### **Issue: Console Shows Error**

**If you see:**
```
❌ Error marking message as deleted: [error]
```

**Then:**
1. Copy the full error
2. Share it with me
3. Try deleting app and rebuilding

### **Issue: Message Deleted from Database (Not Soft)**

**If console shows:**
```
→ Deleting completely (sending status)
```

**Then:**
- This is correct! Messages still "sending" are deleted completely
- Only sent/delivered/read messages are soft deleted

---

## 💡 **Why Soft Delete?**

### **Benefits:**

1. **Legal Compliance**
   - Keep message history for legal/audit purposes
   - Can be retrieved if needed by admin

2. **Better UX**
   - Clean UI (no placeholders)
   - Works like iMessage
   - Both users see it gone

3. **Database Integrity**
   - Conversation history intact
   - Can analyze patterns
   - Undo in future if needed

4. **Privacy**
   - Neither user sees deleted messages
   - Clean conversation view
   - Professional appearance

---

## 📊 **Technical Details**

### **Code Changes:**

1. **Filter deleted messages from query:**
   ```swift
   private var messages: [MessageData] {
       allMessages
           .filter { 
               $0.conversationId == conversation.id && 
               !$0.isDeleted  // ← NEW: Hide deleted
           }
           .sorted { $0.timestamp < $1.timestamp }
   }
   ```

2. **Simplified delete logic:**
   ```swift
   message.isDeleted = true
   try modelContext.save()
   // Message stays in DB but won't appear in UI
   ```

3. **Removed placeholder UI:**
   - No "Message Deleted" text
   - No special styling
   - Message just doesn't render

---

## ✅ **Success Criteria**

**After this update:**
- [ ] Deleted messages invisible in chat
- [ ] Messages stay in database (`isDeleted = true`)
- [ ] Clean UI (no placeholders)
- [ ] Console shows soft delete confirmation
- [ ] Works like iMessage/WhatsApp

---

## 💬 **What to Report**

After testing, please let me know:

1. **UI:** Does message disappear cleanly?
2. **Console:** What does it say when you delete?
3. **Database:** Can you see deleted message in DB test view?
4. **Issues:** Any errors or unexpected behavior?

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

Once this is working:
- ✅ Phase 3 is **complete**!
- 🎯 Ready for **Phase 4: Real-Time Message Delivery**
- 📡 WebSocket API + actual message sending
