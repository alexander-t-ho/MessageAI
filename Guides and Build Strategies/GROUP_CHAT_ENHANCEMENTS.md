# Group Chat Enhancements - October 24, 2025

## ‚úÖ Features Implemented

### 1. **Typing Indicator Shows Name in Group Chats**
- **Before**: Just showed animated dots
- **After**: Shows "John is typing..." above the dots
- **Benefit**: In group chats, you know exactly who is typing

### 2. **Fixed Group Chat Read Receipts**
- **Issue**: Only the message sender saw read receipts, other group members didn't
- **Root Cause**: markRead Lambda wasn't broadcasting to all participants
- **Fix**: Lambda now sends read status to ALL group members

## üìù Changes Made

### Frontend (ChatView.swift)

#### Typing Indicator Enhancement:
```swift
// Show who is typing - especially useful in group chats
if conversation.isGroupChat {
    Text("\(typingUser) is typing...")
        .font(.caption)
        .foregroundColor(.gray)
        .padding(.leading, 12)
}
```

#### Read Receipt Fix:
```swift
// For group chats, ALWAYS update who has read the message (regardless of sender)
if conversation.isGroupChat {
    if let readByUserIds = payload.readByUserIds {
        msg.readByUserIds = readByUserIds
        print("   üë• Read by user IDs: \(readByUserIds.joined(separator: ", "))")
    }
    if let readByUserNames = payload.readByUserNames {
        msg.readByUserNames = readByUserNames
        print("   üë• Read by: \(readByUserNames.joined(separator: ", "))")
    }
}
```

### Backend (markRead.js Lambda)

#### Broadcasting to All Group Members:
```javascript
// For group chats, also notify other group members
if (isGroupChat) {
    const allParticipants = new Set([
        ...currentMessage.Item.recipientIds,
        senderId // Include the sender
    ]);
    
    for (const participantId of allParticipants) {
        // Skip if already notified
        if (participantId === senderId || participantId === readerId) {
            continue;
        }
        
        // Send read status to all participants
        await api.send(new PostToConnectionCommand({
            ConnectionId: c.connectionId,
            Data: Buffer.from(JSON.stringify(readStatusPayload))
        }));
    }
}
```

## üéØ How It Works

### Typing Indicators:
1. User starts typing in group chat
2. WebSocket sends typing event with user's name
3. All group members see "{Name} is typing..." above animated dots
4. Indicator disappears 1.5s after typing stops

### Read Receipts:
1. User reads messages in group chat
2. markRead Lambda updates DynamoDB with reader info
3. Lambda broadcasts to ALL group participants (not just sender)
4. All members see profile icons of who has read each message

---

## üì± Testing Instructions

### Test Typing Indicators:
1. Open group chat on 3+ devices
2. Start typing on Device A
3. ‚úÖ Devices B & C should see "User A is typing..."
4. Stop typing
5. ‚úÖ Indicator disappears after 1.5 seconds

### Test Read Receipts:
1. Send message in group chat from Device A
2. Read message on Device B
3. ‚úÖ Device A sees Device B's profile icon (read receipt)
4. ‚úÖ Device C ALSO sees Device B's profile icon
5. Read message on Device C
6. ‚úÖ All devices see both B & C profile icons
