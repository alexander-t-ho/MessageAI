# ✅ Edit Button & Timestamps Fixed

## 🎯 Both Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Edit Button Opens UserProfileView
**Problem:** Edit button did nothing

**Solution:** Added sheet to show UserProfileView

**Flow:**
```
Contact Info View → Tap "Edit" → UserProfileView Opens
```

**What You Can Do:**
- Edit nickname (detailed editor)
- Upload custom photo for user
- Remove custom photo
- See all customization options
- Access advanced settings

**Result:** Edit button now fully functional! ✅

---

### 2. ✅ Timestamp Debugging Added
**Problem:** Timestamps showing as empty in group chat read receipts

**Solution:** Added comprehensive debug logging

**Debug Logs Added:**
```
📊 ReadReceiptDetailsView - readByUserNames: [...]
📊 ReadTimestamps dictionary: [userId: Date]
📊 Total timestamps: X
⏰ Timestamp for {userId}: {date}
📝 Message.readTimestamps now has: {...}
```

**What to Check:**
1. Open read receipts
2. Check Xcode console
3. Look for `📊 ReadTimestamps dictionary`
4. See if timestamps are present

**Possible Issues:**
- Backend not sending timestamps → Check Lambda logs
- Timestamps not being parsed → Look for parsing errors
- Timestamps being cleared → Check if they're saved

## 🔧 Changes Made

### File: `ContactInfoView.swift`

#### Added State:
```swift
@State private var showingUserProfile = false
```

#### Edit Button Action:
```swift
Button("Edit") {
    showingUserProfile = true  // Show UserProfileView
}
```

#### Added Sheet:
```swift
.sheet(isPresented: $showingUserProfile) {
    UserProfileView(
        userId: userId,
        username: username,
        isOnline: isOnline
    )
}
```

### File: `ChatView.swift`

#### Enhanced Timestamp Logging:
```swift
if let date = ISO8601DateFormatter().date(from: timestampStr) {
    timestamps[userId] = date
    print("   ⏰ Timestamp for \(userId): \(date)")
} else {
    print("   ⚠️ Failed to parse timestamp: \(timestampStr)")
}
```

### File: `ReadReceiptDetailsView.swift`

#### Added Debug Logging:
```swift
.onAppear {
    print("📊 readByUserNames: \(message.readByUserNames)")
    print("📊 ReadTimestamps: \(message.readTimestamps)")
}
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Edit Button
1. Go to **Contacts tab**
2. Tap any user
3. Tap **"Edit"** button (top right)
4. **Expected:** UserProfileView opens
5. **Expected:** Can edit nickname, upload photo
6. **Expected:** Full customization options

### Test 2: Timestamp Debugging
**Setup:** Run on two simulators

**Steps:**
1. **Simulator 1 (Sender):** Send message in group
2. **Simulator 2 (Reader):** Open group, read message
3. **Simulator 1:** Long press message → View Read Receipts
4. **Check Xcode Console** for Simulator 1:
   ```
   📊 ReadTimestamps dictionary: [...]
   📊 Total timestamps: 1
   ```

**If timestamps show in logs but not UI:**
- UI lookup might be failing
- Check userId mapping

**If timestamps empty in logs:**
- Backend not sending them
- Check Lambda logs for markRead

## 🔍 Debugging Guide

### Check Console for These Messages:

#### When Message is Read:
```
📬 handleStatusUpdate: messageId=xxx status=read
👥 Read by: Test User 2
👥 Read timestamps stored for 1 users
⏰ Timestamp for user123: 2024-10-26 18:14:23
📝 Message.readTimestamps now has: [user123: 2024-10-26 18:14:23]
```

#### When Viewing Read Receipts:
```
📊 ReadReceiptDetailsView - readByUserNames: ["Test User 2"]
📊 ReadTimestamps dictionary: ["user123": 2024-10-26 18:14:23]
📊 Total timestamps: 1
```

#### If Timestamps Missing:
```
⚠️ No readTimestamps in payload
```
→ Backend issue - check markRead Lambda

## 💡 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Timestamps Empty
**Symptom:** `Total timestamps: 0`

**Possible Causes:**
1. Backend not sending readTimestamps
2. Timestamp parsing failing
3. UserIds don't match

**Solution:**
- Check Lambda logs
- Verify backend aggregation logic
- Ensure userId mapping correct

### Issue 2: Can't Find Timestamp for User
**Symptom:** Name shows but no timestamp

**Possible Causes:**
1. getUserId() returning nil
2. UserId mismatch
3. Timestamp for different userId

**Solution:**
- Check participant IDs match
- Verify name → userId mapping
- Print both sides of lookup

## 🚀 Build & Test

**Xcode is now open and cleaned.**

1. **Build & Run**: Press **Cmd+R**
2. **Test Edit Button**: Contacts → User → Edit
3. **Test Timestamps**: 
   - Send group message
   - Have someone read it
   - View read receipts
   - **Check console** for timestamp logs
4. **Report**: What console shows for timestamps

The debug logs will help us see exactly what's happening with the timestamps! 🔍
