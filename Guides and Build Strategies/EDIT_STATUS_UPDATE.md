# Edit Feature Status Update - October 24, 2025

## ✅ FIXED: Conversation List Preview

### Problem:
The conversation list was showing the old message text even after editing

### Solution:
Updated both `saveEdit()` and `handleEditedMessage()` to update the conversation's `lastMessage` property when editing the most recent message.

### Code Changes:
```swift
// Update conversation's lastMessage if this was the most recent message
if let lastMsg = visibleMessages.last, lastMsg.id == message.id {
    conversation.lastMessage = trimmedText
    print("   📝 Updated conversation preview to: \(trimmedText)")
}
```

### Result:
✅ When you edit the latest message, the conversation list preview will now update to show the edited text

## ⚠️ STILL WORKING: Edit Not Syncing to Receiver

### Current Symptoms:
1. ✅ Sender sees the edit locally
2. ✅ "Edited" label appears for sender
3. ✅ Edit is sent to WebSocket successfully
4. ❌ Lambda returns "Internal server error"
5. ❌ Receiver doesn't see the edit
6. ❌ Conversation list on receiver still shows old text

### Console Evidence:
```
✅ Edit sent via WebSocket: EC664E28-B82B-4F45-8134-40C5A099CEB3
   Successfully sent to API Gateway
📥 Received WebSocket message: ["requestId": S9r92H_-oAMEgxQ=, "message": Internal server error]
```

### Lambda Status:
- ✅ Lambda is Active and responding
- ✅ Lambda correctly validates payloads (returns 400 for missing fields)
- ❌ Lambda is failing when processing actual edit requests from the app

### Likely Causes:
1. **Missing or incorrect data in the edit payload** - The Lambda might be expecting different field names or structure
2. **Connection lookup issues** - Lambda might not be finding the recipient connections
3. **DynamoDB permissions** - Lambda might lack permissions to update messages

## What Was Fixed in This Session:

1. ✅ **Compilation error fixed** - Added `isDeleted` property to `ConversationData` model
2. ✅ **Conversation deletion crash fixed** - Changed to soft delete instead of hard delete
3. ✅ **Conversation list preview fixed** - Now updates when editing the latest message

## What Still Needs Work:

1. ⚠️ **Edit sync to receiver** - Lambda returning "Internal server error" preventing broadcast
2. 🔍 **Need to diagnose** - Exact cause of Lambda failure when processing edits

---

## Testing Instructions:

### Test the Fixed Preview Update:
1. Edit the latest message in any conversation
2. Go back to conversation list
3. ✅ Should see the edited text in the preview

### Current Edit Sync Issue:
1. Edit a message on one device
2. ❌ Other device won't see the edit (yet)
3. ❌ Conversation list on other device shows old text

---

## Next Steps:

1. **Diagnose Lambda issue** - Need to see actual error in Lambda logs
2. **Fix broadcast mechanism** - Ensure edited messages are sent to all recipients
3. **Test end-to-end** - Verify edits sync across all devices

The edit feature is partially working (local updates and preview) but needs the sync issue resolved for full functionality.
