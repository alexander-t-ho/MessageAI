# ✅ Voice Recording - All Build Errors Fixed!

## 🔧 Errors Fixed

### 1. ✅ Missing Combine Import
**Error:** Type 'VoiceMessageRecorder' does not conform to protocol 'ObservableObject'

**Fix:** Added `import Combine` to VoiceMessageRecorder.swift

---

### 2. ✅ Deprecated Audio APIs
**Errors:** 
- 'recordPermission' was deprecated in iOS 17.0
- 'requestRecordPermission' was deprecated in iOS 17.0

**Fix:** Updated to use iOS 17+ APIs with fallback:
```swift
if #available(iOS 17.0, *) {
    AVAudioApplication.shared.recordPermission
} else {
    AVAudioSession.sharedInstance().recordPermission
}
```

---

### 3. ✅ Function Not Found
**Error:** Cannot find 'formatRecordingDuration' in scope

**Fix:** Moved function definition before `body` where it's used

---

## ✅ Build Status: CLEAN

No compilation errors! ✅
