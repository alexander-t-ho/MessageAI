## 📝 **Code Changes in phase-9:**

### **Swift (Client):**
1. `WebSocketService.swift`:
   - Added `currentlyViewedConversationId` property
   - Always includes `recipientId` in payload (for compatibility)

2. `ChatView.swift`:
   - Sets/clears `currentlyViewedConversationId` on appear/disappear
   - Immediately updates badge when conversation opens
   - Calculates total unread across all conversations

3. `ConversationListView.swift`:
   - Checks if user is viewing conversation before incrementing unread
   - Updates badge when total unread count changes
   - Sets initial badge on app start

4. `MessageAIApp.swift`:
   - Tracks scene phase (active/inactive/background)
   - Requests notification permissions on active

### **JavaScript (Backend):**
1. `sendMessage.js`:
   - Added `nickname` parameter extraction
   - Properly handles group chat conversation names
   - Sends to all recipients in group

---

## 🎯 **What to Test:**

1. **Group Chat First:**
   - Create new group
   - Send messages
   - Verify all users receive
   - Check read receipts

2. **Badge Behavior:**
   - Send messages while app closed
   - Check badge count
   - Open app, check badge
   - Open conversation, badge should clear instantly

3. **Active Conversation:**
   - Have conversation open
   - Receive message
   - Badge should NOT increment

4. **Notifications:**
   - Close app (home button)
   - Send message within 10 seconds
   - Banner should appear

---

## 💡 **If Something Doesn't Work:**

### **Group Messages Not Sending:**
```bash
# Check Lambda logs:
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/websocket-sendMessage_AlexHo \
  --since 2m --region us-east-1 --no-cli-pager

# Look for:
✅ "✅ Group chat message saved for X recipients"
✅ "📡 Sending to X recipient(s)"
❌ Any errors
```

### **Badge Not Clearing:**
```
# Check Xcode console for:
✅ "🔔 Badge updated on chat open: 0"
✅ "👁️ Now viewing conversation: ..."
❌ Any errors
```

### **Notifications Not Appearing:**
```
1. Check Settings → MessageAI → Notifications (must be enabled)
2. Don't force-quit (use home button only)
3. Send message within 30 seconds of backgrounding
```

---

## ✅ **You're Ready to Test!**

**Current branch:** `phase-9`
**All changes:** Committed and pushed ✅
**Backend:** Deployed ✅

Start with the group chat test to verify the Lambda fix worked, then test the badge behavior.

**Everything should be working perfectly now!** 🎉

---

## 🔄 **If You Want Clean State:**

If you want to start from a known-good state:

```bash
# This is the last commit before badge changes:
git log --oneline | grep "comprehensive notification status"
# 1d7914c Add comprehensive notification status...

# To see what changed since then:
git diff 1d7914c..HEAD
```

But you're currently at the latest state which includes all fixes! Test this first. 🚀
