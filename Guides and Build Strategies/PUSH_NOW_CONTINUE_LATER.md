## 🎯 Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Push Now, Features in New Branch (RECOMMENDED)
```bash
# 1. Push current amazing work
git push origin main

# 2. Create feature branch for next features
git checkout -b feature/user-status-sync

# 3. Implement remaining features
# - Profile sync
# - Nicknames UI
# - Chat header
# - Notification deep link

# 4. Test thoroughly
# 5. Merge when ready
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ AI features live NOW
- ✅ Read receipts fix deployed
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns
- ✅ Can iterate on new features
- ✅ Safe to test and refine

### Option 2: Implement Everything Before Push
```bash
# Continue working on main
# Implement all 4 remaining features
# Then push everything at once
```

**Considerations**:
- Takes longer to get AI features live
- More complex testing all at once
- Larger commit batch
