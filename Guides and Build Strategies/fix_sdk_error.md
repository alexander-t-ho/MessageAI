# Fix SDK Error - SOLUTION

## The Problem
The Assets.xcassets error about "No simulator runtime version" is caused by a mismatch between:
- Your Xcode's SDK version (26.0)
- The deployment target in project settings (was set to 26.0, now 18.0)
- The simulator runtime available

## IMMEDIATE FIX - Do This Now:

### Option 1: Use Xcode GUI (Easiest)
1. Open Xcode
2. Click on **MessageAI** project in navigator
3. Select **MessageAI** target
4. Go to **Build Settings** tab
5. Search for "iOS Deployment Target"
6. Change it to **17.0** (or lower)
7. Clean build: **Cmd+Shift+K**
8. Build and run: **Cmd+R**

### Option 2: Direct Simulator Launch
1. Open Xcode
2. Go to **Window** → **Devices and Simulators**
3. Select **Simulators** tab
4. Click **+** to add a new simulator
5. Choose:
   - Device Type: **iPhone 17 Pro**
   - OS Version: **iOS 26.0**
6. Click **Create**
7. Now select this simulator and build

### Option 3: Use Generic Build
1. In Xcode, select device dropdown
2. Choose **"Any iOS Device (arm64)"**
3. Build (won't run, but will compile)
4. Then switch to a specific simulator

## Why This Happened
- Xcode 26.0 uses iOS 26.0 SDK
- The project was set to target iOS 26.0 minimum
- But the simulator runtime lookup is failing
- We've now set it to iOS 18.0 which should be compatible

## The Changes Made:
- ✅ Set `IPHONEOS_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 18.0`
- ✅ Added `SDKROOT = iphoneos`
- ✅ Added `SUPPORTED_PLATFORMS = "iphoneos iphonesimulator"`
- ✅ Cleaned DerivedData

## If Still Not Working:
1. In Xcode, go to **Product** → **Destination** → **Destination Architectures** → **Show All Run Destinations**
2. Select any available simulator
3. Or download iOS 18.0 runtime from **Xcode** → **Settings** → **Platforms**

The app itself is ready - this is just a build configuration issue!
