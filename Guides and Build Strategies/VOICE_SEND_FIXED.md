# ✅ Voice Message Send Button Fixed!

## 🎯 Issue Fixed

**Problem:** Unable to send voice message after recording

**Root Cause:** `sendVoiceMessage()` was just logging, not actually sending or cleaning up state

**Solution:** Implemented full send functionality with placeholder message

---

## ✅ What Happens Now When You Send

### 1. Creates Message Locally
```swift
MessageData:
- Content: "🎤 Voice message (0:15)"
- Timestamp: Current time
- Status: "sending"
```

### 2. Saves to Database
- Message appears in chat immediately
- Shows as your message (blue bubble)

### 3. Sends via WebSocket
- Broadcasts to other participants
- Updates conversation last message
- Marks as sent/delivered

### 4. Cleans Up Preview
- Closes preview UI
- Resets state variables
- Returns to normal input
- Audio file kept for Phase B upload

## 📱 What You'll See in Chat

### Sent Message:
```
┌────────────────────────────┐
│                            │
│    🎤 Voice message (0:15) │  ← Blue bubble (your message)
│                            │
└────────────────────────────┘
```

### Received Message:
```
┌────────────────────────────┐

│                            │
