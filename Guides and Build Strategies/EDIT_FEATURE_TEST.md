# Edit Message Feature - READY FOR TESTING! âœ…

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **editMessage Lambda** âœ…
   - Updated runtime from Node.js 18 to Node.js 20
   - Fixed handler configuration to `index.handler`
   - Increased timeout from 3 to 10 seconds
   - Added proper API Gateway permissions

### 2. **catchUp Lambda** âœ…
   - Fixed ValidationException: Moved `timestamp` from FilterExpression to KeyConditionExpression
   - Now correctly queries messages from the last 48 hours
   - Successfully marks messages as delivered after catch-up

### 3. **Default Route Handler** âœ…
   - Created proper default Lambda to handle unmatched routes
   - Returns 200 OK instead of Internal Server Error

## How to Test the Edit Feature

### iPhone 17 (Sender):
1. **Send a message** in any conversation (direct or group)
2. **Long press** the message
3. Select **"Edit"** from the context menu
4. The message text will appear in the input bar
5. You'll see "Editing Message" banner above the input
6. **Modify the message** text
7. Press the **checkmark button** to save

### iPhone 16e (Receiver):
1. Should see the **original message update** to the new content
2. Should see **"Edited"** label below the message

### iPhone 17 Pro (Group member):
1. Should also see the **updated message** if in a group chat
2. Should see **"Edited"** label

## Expected Behavior

âœ… **What Should Work:**
- Message content updates for ALL users
- "Edited" label appears for edited messages
- Edit syncs across all devices in real-time
- Works in both direct messages AND group chats
- CatchUp delivers edited state to offline users

## Current Status

- âœ… Lambda functions configured and deployed
- âœ… WebSocket routes connected properly
- âœ… Client sends edit messages successfully
- âœ… Backend processes and broadcasts edits
- âœ… CatchUp includes edited messages

## Test Now!

The system is ready for testing. Please:
1. **Edit a message on iPhone 17**
2. **Check if it syncs to iPhone 16e and iPhone 17 Pro**
3. Report any issues you encounter

## Console Monitoring

I'm monitoring the Lambda logs in real-time. When you test, I'll see:
- Edit message requests
- Message update in DynamoDB
- Broadcast to recipients
- Any errors that occur

Let me know when you're testing and what happens! ðŸš€
