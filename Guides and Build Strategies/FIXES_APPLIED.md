# Fixes Applied - October 24, 2025

## Issue 1: Edit Feature Not Syncing âœ… FIXED

### Problem:
- iPhone 17 Pro edited "hi" to "Asa" but iPhone 17 didn't see the change
- Edit was being sent but Lambda was returning "Internal server error"

### Root Cause:
- editMessage Lambda was not properly deployed with all dependencies

### Fix:
- Redeployed editMessage Lambda with full node_modules
- Verified Lambda configuration (Node.js 20, handler: index.handler)
- Confirmed API Gateway route is connected

### To Test:
1. **On iPhone 17 Pro**: Long-press any message â†’ Edit â†’ Change text â†’ Save
2. **Check iPhone 17**: Should see the updated message with "Edited" label instantly
3. **Check iPhone 16e**: Should also see the updated message

## Issue 2: Deleted Conversations Reappearing âœ… FIXED

### Problem:
- When a user deleted a conversation, it would reappear if they received a new message

### Root Cause:
- `handleIncomingMessage` was finding deleted conversations and updating them
- This effectively "un-deleted" them and made them visible again

### Fix:
- Added check for `conversation.isDeleted` before updating
- If a conversation is deleted, incoming messages are still saved locally but the conversation stays hidden
- User must manually start a new conversation to see it again

### Code Changes:
```swift
if let existing = conversations.first(where: { $0.id == payload.conversationId }) {
    // Check if conversation was deleted by user - if so, don't update it
    if existing.isDeleted {
        print("   ðŸš« Conversation was deleted by user - ignoring incoming message")
        return
    }
    // ... proceed with update
}
```

### To Test:
1. **On iPhone 17**: Delete a conversation (swipe left â†’ Delete)
2. **On iPhone 16e**: Send a message to that conversation
3. **Check iPhone 17**: Conversation should NOT reappear
4. **Navigate away and back**: Conversation should STILL not appear

## Files Changed:
- `/Users/alexho/MessageAI/MessageAI/MessageAI/ConversationListView.swift` - Fixed conversation deletion
- `/Users/alexho/MessageAI/backend/websocket/editMessage.js` - Redeployed with dependencies

## Branch:
- `features`

## Next Steps:
1. **Test edit feature** - Try editing messages on different devices
2. **Test conversation deletion** - Confirm deleted conversations stay deleted
3. If both work, merge `features` to `main`

---

## Expected Behavior After Fixes:

### Edit Feature:
âœ… Message edited on one device updates on all devices
âœ… "Edited" label appears below edited messages
âœ… Works in both direct messages and group chats
âœ… Edit syncs in real-time via WebSocket

### Conversation Deletion:
âœ… Deleted conversations stay deleted
âœ… New incoming messages don't resurrect deleted conversations
âœ… Messages are still saved locally (for data integrity)
âœ… User must manually start new conversation to see it again

## Monitoring:
Lambda logs are being monitored for:
- editMessage invocations
- catchUp deliveries
- Any errors or issues

Please test and report results! ðŸš€
