## 🧪 TEST IMMEDIATELY

### Test #1: Group Chat Read Receipts (CRITICAL)

**The DynamoDB index is now ACTIVE - this will work!**

1. **Send a NEW message** in the group chat (from sender - left device)
2. **Open the chat** on middle and right devices
3. **Sender should now see**:
   ```
   Message bubble
   ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
   Read by  👤👤  1:49 PM
            TU AT
   ```
   
**Expected**: Profile icons of "Test User" and "Alex Test" overlapping!

### Test #2: Notification Banners

1. **While viewing a conversation**: Send yourself a message
   - **Expected**: No banner (just message appears)
   
2. **On home screen**: Have someone send you a message
   - **Expected**: Banner shows

3. **App in background**: Have someone send you a message  
   - **Expected**: Banner shows

## 📱 Test Commands

### Watch Lambda logs while testing:
```bash
# Terminal 1: Watch markRead
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/websocket-markRead_AlexHo --follow --region us-east-1

# Look for:
# [aggregated] Aggregated readers for {messageId}:
#    Names: Test User, Alex Test  ✅ Should work now!
```

### Check index status:
```bash
aws dynamodb describe-table \
  --table-name Messages_AlexHo \
  --region us-east-1 \
  --query 'Table.GlobalSecondaryIndexes[?IndexName==`conversationId-timestamp-index`].IndexStatus'
```

Should return: `"ACTIVE"` ✅
