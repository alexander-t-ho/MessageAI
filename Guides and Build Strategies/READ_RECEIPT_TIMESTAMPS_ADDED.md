## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Data Source:
```swift
message.readTimestamps: [String: Date]
// Maps userId to timestamp when they read it
```

### Timestamp Lookup:
```swift
1. Get userId from participant name
2. Look up timestamp in message.readTimestamps[userId]
3. Format with DateFormatter
4. Display next to user's name
```

### Formatting:
```swift
DateFormatter:
- timeStyle: .short  // "2:30 PM"
- dateStyle: .none   // No date, just time
```

---

## 📊 Information Hierarchy

### ReadReceiptDetailsView:
```
Primary:   Nickname/Name (left)
Secondary: Real name (if nickname set)
Tertiary:  Timestamp (right)
```

### GroupReadReceiptsView:
```
Row 1: Message preview
Row 2: Timestamp sent
Row 3: Read status count
Row 4: Horizontal scroll of readers
       - Name
       - Time read
```
