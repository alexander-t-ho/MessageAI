# Edit Feature - Fixed! âœ…

## The Problem
The `isEdited` and `editedAt` properties were NOT actually in the DataModels.swift file on disk, even though some tools showed they were there. This was causing compilation errors.

## The Solution
I've now properly added the edit properties to match the pattern of working properties like `isDeleted`:

### DataModels.swift (FIXED)
```swift
// Line 40-41: Property declarations
var isEdited: Bool = false // True if message was edited  
var editedAt: Date? // When the message was last edited

// Line 64-65: Init parameters (already there)
isEdited: Bool = false,
editedAt: Date? = nil,

// Line 86-87: Init assignments (already there)
self.isEdited = isEdited
self.editedAt = editedAt
```

## Next Steps

### In Xcode:
1. **Product â†’ Clean Build Folder** (âŒ˜â‡§K)
2. **Delete apps** from all 3 simulators (long press â†’ Remove App)
3. **Build & Run** (âŒ˜R) on each simulator

## Test the Edit Feature

After rebuilding:
1. Send a message
2. Long press YOUR message
3. Select "Edit" from menu
4. Message content appears in input bar
5. Edit banner shows above input
6. Modify the text
7. Tap checkmark to save
8. Message shows "Edited" label
9. Other devices receive the edit via WebSocket

- âœ… DataModels.swift - Edit properties added correctly
- âœ… ChatView.swift - Edit UI implemented  
- âœ… WebSocketService.swift - Edit message handling
