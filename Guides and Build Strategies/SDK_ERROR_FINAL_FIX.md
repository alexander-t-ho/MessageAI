# Final SDK Error Fix Applied

## The Persistent Issue:
```
No simulator runtime version from ["23A8464"] available to use with iphonesimulator SDK version 23A339
```

This error occurs because `actool` (Asset Catalog Compiler) is checking SDK versions even though the runtime IS installed.

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Asset Catalog Compiler Settings
- ✅ `ASSETCATALOG_NOTICES = NO` - Disabled notices
- ✅ `ASSETCATALOG_WARNINGS = NO` - Disabled warnings  
- ✅ `ASSETCATALOG_COMPILER_STANDALONE_ICON_BEHAVIOR = all` - Process all icons

### 2. Deployment Target
- ✅ Set to iOS 15.0 (lower = less strict SDK checks)

### 3. SDK Configuration
- ✅ Explicitly set simulator SDK root
- ✅ Platform-specific SDK settings

### 4. Clean Build Environment
- ✅ Deleted all DerivedData
- ✅ Removed build folder
- ✅ Restarted Xcode

## ✅ Xcode Has Reopened - Try Now:

1. **In Xcode:**
   - Select **iPhone 17 Pro** (or 17, 16e) from device dropdown
   
2. **Clean Build:**
   - Press **Cmd+Shift+K**
   
3. **Build:**
   - Press **Cmd+R**

## If Error STILL Persists:

The error means Xcode's asset catalog compiler is being extremely strict. Here's the nuclear option:

### Option A: Use a Generic iOS Device
1. In device dropdown, select **"Any iOS Device (arm64)"**
2. This skips simulator-specific checks
3. Build with Cmd+B (won't run, but will compile)
4. Then switch back to iPhone 17 Pro and run

### Option B: Rebuild Simulators from Scratch
```bash
# Delete ALL simulators
xcrun simctl delete all

# Recreate them
xcrun simctl create "iPhone 17 Pro" com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-17-Pro com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-26-0
xcrun simctl create "iPhone 17" com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-17 com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-26-0  
xcrun simctl create "iPhone 16e" com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimDeviceType.iPhone-16e com.apple.CoreSimulator.SimRuntime.iOS-26-0

# Restart CoreSimulator service
killall com.apple.CoreSimulator.CoreSimulatorService
```

### Option C: Temporarily Remove Asset Catalog Compilation
If you just want to test the app functionality:
1. Remove `Assets.xcassets` from the project temporarily
2. Build and run
3. App will work but won't have icons
4. Add Assets back later when SDK issue is resolved

## What We Know:
- ✅ Runtime IS installed (iOS 26.0.1 - 23A8464)
- ✅ SDK IS installed (iPhoneSimulator 26.0 - 23A339)
- ❌ Asset compiler sees them as incompatible
- ✅ This is a tool bug, not your project

## Your Cloudy App Settings:
- **Name**: Cloudy ✅
- **Bundle ID**: com.alexho.Cloudy ✅
- **Icons**: All sizes present ✅
- **Simulators**: 3 iPhones ready ✅
- **Signing**: Configured ✅

## Next Step:
**Try building now (Cmd+R) with the new settings!**

If it still fails, we'll go with Option B (rebuild simulators) or Option C (temporary workaround).
