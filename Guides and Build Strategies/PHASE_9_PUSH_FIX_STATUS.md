# Phase 9: Push Notifications Status Update

## ‚úÖ **Fixed Issues**

### **1. Unread Count Badge (FIXED)**
- **Problem:** Badge was showing 30 unread messages including deleted ones
- **Solution:**
  - Filter out deleted conversations
  - Only count unread, non-deleted messages
  - Reset conversation unread count when viewing
  - Only increment for messages from others
- **Status:** ‚úÖ WORKING - Badge now shows accurate count

### **2. Background Modes Configuration**
- Added Info.plist with required background modes:
  - `remote-notification` - For push notifications
  - `fetch` - For background updates
- **Status:** ‚úÖ CONFIGURED

### **3. Lambda Deployment**
- Updated sendMessage Lambda with push notification code
- Redeployed to AWS with latest changes
- **Status:** ‚úÖ DEPLOYED

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Push Notifications - Setup Required**

### **Why Push Notifications Aren't Working Yet:**

Push notifications require Apple Push Notification service (APNs) configuration. Here's what's missing:

### **Step 1: Apple Developer Portal**
1. Go to [developer.apple.com](https://developer.apple.com)
2. Navigate to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
3. Create an App ID with Push Notifications capability
4. Generate an APNs certificate or authentication key

### **Step 2: AWS SNS Configuration**
1. Go to AWS Console ‚Üí Simple Notification Service (SNS)
2. Create Platform Application
3. Choose "Apple iOS/Mac OS"
4. Upload your APNs certificate/key
5. Copy the Platform Application ARN

### **Step 3: Update Lambda Environment**
```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name websocket-sendMessage_AlexHo \
  --environment Variables="{
    MESSAGES_TABLE=Messages_AlexHo,
    CONNECTIONS_TABLE=Connections_AlexHo,
    DEVICES_TABLE=DeviceTokens_AlexHo,
    SNS_PLATFORM_APP_ARN=arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:YOUR_ACCOUNT:app/APNS_SANDBOX/YOUR_APP
  }" \
  --region us-east-1
```

### **Step 4: Test Push Notifications**
1. Build app on real device (simulator doesn't support push)
2. Accept notification permission
3. Close app completely
4. Send message from another device
5. Should receive push notification banner

## üì± **What's Working Now (Without Push Setup):**

### **‚úÖ Unread Badge Count**
- Shows correct count on back button
- Updates in real-time
- Excludes deleted messages
- Resets when viewing conversation

### **‚úÖ Notification Permission**
- App requests permission on login
- Device token captured successfully
- Token sent to backend via WebSocket

### **‚úÖ Foreground Notifications**
- Banners appear when app is open
- Sound and badge updates work

---

## üöß **Temporary Workaround**

While push notifications aren't configured:
- The app still receives messages via WebSocket when open
- Unread badge shows missed messages
- Opening app triggers catch-up for missed messages

---

## üîë **Key Points**

1. **Unread badge is fully functional** - no setup needed
2. **Push requires APNs certificate** - one-time Apple Developer setup
3. **SNS Platform App needed** - links Apple and AWS
4. **Everything else is ready** - code deployed and waiting
